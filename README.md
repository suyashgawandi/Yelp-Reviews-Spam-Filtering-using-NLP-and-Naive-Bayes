# Classification of Yelp Reviews using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
This notebook was the part of my Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course on Udemy where I have used NLP for Yelp reviews dataset to classify reviews into Spam reviews or Normal reviews (Spam Filtering in a nutshell)

This project vectorizes text data using CountVectorizer function in Python's sklearn library and it is used for training the Machine Learning models (which in this case are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression)
